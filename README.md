## Resources

This exam is different than AZ-300, it has no labs and questions are geared towards design and architecture best practices in Azure rather than concrete implementaitons. Still, it's important to  practice yourself in the portal, but not as essencial as for AZ-300.

Resources also contain recommendations how to make best use of each one. At least this was how I was using each resource and it yielded good results.

### _Resources are ordered from used **least** often to used **most** often (please note that this is purely subjective on my part and something else might work better for you)_

1. [Video from MS Ignite with tips on taking the exam](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/78629?source=sessions)

    **How to use:** watch one time to understand exam requirements and learn about varioius tips and tricks.

2. [Cloud Design Patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/)

    **How to use:** use as support resource if you want to know more about any given topic.

3. [Azure Architecture Center](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/architecture/)

    **How to use:** if you are interested in learning more about given topic, look it up on the architecture center and study.

4. [Self paced Azure labs](https://www.microsoft.com/HandsOnLabs/SelfPacedLabs)

    **How to use:** perform labs and/or read the documentation: Links are scattered across README files.

5. [Azure Tips and Tricks Youtube playlist curated by Microsoft](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLasX02E8BPCNCK8Thcxu-Y-XcBUbhFWC)

    **How to use:** choose videos you are interested in and watch, most of the videos are very short and have enought info to help you understand the topic.

6. [Plularsight Courses](https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/microsoft-azure-architect-design-az-301)

    **How to use:** View while learning certain topic: Links to videos from Plularsight are scattered across README files or watch on demand.

7. [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me)

    **How to use:**

    * There are plenty of detailed short videos describing many topics needed to pass the exam in detail.

    * You will need to start free month with LinkedIn, but you can cancell afterwards

    * Search topic you are interested in (copy/paste from exam topics) and watch videos

    * Content is detailed and almost always has a lot of Azure Portal print screens

8. [Udemy "AZ-301 Azure Architect Design Exam Prep" by Scott Duffy](https://www.udemy.com/course/az301-azure/)

    **How to use:** Watch relevant section and try to follow along on Azure Portal.

9. [Azure Landing Page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/)

    **How to use:**

    * This is main resource I was working with most of the time

    * Select "Products" and what you want to learn about. From there you will have access to full documentation and other areas. I highly recommend checking out the "Pricing" section as well as "FAQ", they both contain information useful during the exam.

        ![Products](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Piotr1215/azure-architect-exams-resources/master/use-azure-portal.png)

    * Another very useful resource are Solutions -> Architectures. This gives you a good overview how reference architectures are setup on Azure and helps a lot with the exam.

## Prepare for the exam

When I was confident I have enought preparation and understand the material, it was time to **schedule the exam**. Scheduling exam was important to set a date in calendar and make sure I stay focus and plan my time well.

**10 days** from exam I scheduled final preparation plan focusing on each section as below. Each time I would use the links, refresh core info, do a lab and most importantly go to Azure Portal and try to perform given task myself. I also used mindmaps and OneNote to keep the learning material organized.

* Day 1: Determine workload requirements (10-15%)

* Days 2-3: Design for identity and security (20-25%)

* Day 4: Design a data platform solution (15-20%)

* Day 5: Design a business continuity strategy (15-20%)

* Day 6: Design for deployment, migration, and integration (10-15%)

* Day 7: Design an infrastructure strategy (15-20%)

* Day 8-9: Practice exams and mock questions, final review. Please **don't** use so called braindumps. I used [AZ-301: The complete practice test, Azure Architect Design](https://www.udemy.com/course/exam-az-301-microsoft-azure-architect-design-test/) (bought cheap on Udemy during Cyber Week)

* Day 10: EXAM! Make sure to get plenty of sleep and schedule the exam in the time when you are most active (for me it is late morning)

### **Good luck :)
