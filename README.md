This exam is different than AZ-300, it has no labs and questions are geared towards design and architecture best practices in Azure rather than concrete implementaitons. Still, it's important to  practice yourself in the portal, but not as essencial as for AZ-300.

## Prepare for the exam

When I was confident I have enought preparation and understand the material, it was time to **schedule the exam**. Scheduling exam was important to set a date in calendar and make sure I stay focus and plan my time well.

**10 days** from exam I scheduled final preparation plan focusing on each section as below. Each time I would use the links, refresh core info, do a lab and most importantly go to Azure Portal and try to perform given task myself. I also used mindmaps and OneNote to keep the learning material organized.

* Day 1: Determine workload requirements (10-15%)

* Days 2-3: Design for identity and security (20-25%)

* Day 4: Design a data platform solution (15-20%)

* Day 5: Design a business continuity strategy (15-20%)

* Day 6: Design for deployment, migration, and integration (10-15%)

* Day 7: Design an infrastructure strategy (15-20%)

* Day 8-9: Practice exams and mock questions, final review. Please **don't** use so called braindumps. I used [AZ-301: The complete practice test, Azure Architect Design](https://www.udemy.com/course/exam-az-301-microsoft-azure-architect-design-test/) (bought cheap on Udemy during Cyber Week)

* Day 10: EXAM! Make sure to get plenty of sleep and schedule the exam in the time when you are most active (for me it is late morning)

### **Good luck :)**
